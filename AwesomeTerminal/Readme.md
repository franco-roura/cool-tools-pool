# An awesome terminal

This is just a wrapper installer for Zsh, OhMyZsh, PowerLevel9k and some gems I like.

## How to install

1) Download the latest iTerm2 release from https://iterm2.com and open it, it'll ask you to move itself to the applications folder.
2) From iTerm2 run `./install.sh`
3) From iTerm2 go to `Preferences -> Profiles -> Other actions... -> Import JSON profiles` and import `iTerm2_profile.json` 

It is important to load the profile **after** running the installation script or it wont find Nerdfonts and your glyphs will look bad.

## How to use

Open iTerm2 and enjoy the new look!
